# 🎲 Pitchanary: Game Rules (Updated Format)

---

## 🔥 What Is Pitchanary?

*Pitchanary* is a competitive team game where players pitch **companies or brands** to their teammates without saying the name, trademarks, or any prohibited words. The goal is to sell the idea *as if it’s new* — focusing on how you would pitch it at launch, not describing its history or past success.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Pitch your assigned company or brand in a way that helps your teammates guess it quickly.
- Do **not** say the company or brand name, trademarks, or any prohibited words.
- Avoid **historical or retrospective descriptions** — pitch like it is launching today.
- Watch out for **Instant Death guesses** — guessing a related but incorrect company or brand causes immediate loss for that round.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 1. **Pitch Like It’s New**

- Describe the company or brand *as if it’s brand new* on the market.
- Avoid mentioning its past achievements, legacy, or history.
- Example:
  - ❌ “The longest-running animated show.”  
  - ✔️ “A new animated sitcom about a dysfunctional suburban family.”

### 2. **Prohibited Words and Trademarks**

- Company or brand names and trademarks are **never allowed**.
- Each card lists **prohibited words** that cannot be used in your pitch.
- Saying any prohibited word results in losing that round.

### 3. **Instant Death Guesses**

- Each card includes **3 related companies or brands**.
- Only one is the correct answer for the current round.
- Guessing one of the other two immediately ends the round with zero points.

## 🕹️ How to Play

### Setup

- Divide into two teams.
- Shuffle the Pitchanary deck.
- The game lasts **9 rounds**.

### Each Round

1. Draw **1 card** containing 3 companies or brands (e.g., `["Coke", "Dr Pepper", "Red Bull"]`).
2. Determine the company or brand to pitch based on the round number:
   - Rounds 1, 4, 7 → pitch the **first** company/brand.
   - Rounds 2, 5, 8 → pitch the **second** company/brand.
   - Rounds 3, 6, 9 → pitch the **third** company/brand.
3. The pitcher reads the card and delivers a pitch **without using the prohibited words or trademarks**.
4. Teammates guess aloud:
   - Correct guess: 1 point.
   - Guessing one of the other two companies or brands on the card: **Instant Death**, round ends with zero points.
5. Continue until all 9 rounds are completed.

### Scoring

- 1 point for each correctly guessed company or brand.
- 0 points if prohibited words are used or an Instant Death guess occurs.
- Maximum score is 9 points.
