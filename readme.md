# Pitchanary

**Pitchanary** is a competitive team game where players pitch well-known **companies or brands** to their teammates without saying the name, trademarks, or any prohibited words. The goal is to sell the idea *as if it’s new* focusing on how you would pitch it at launch, not describing its history or past success.

## Objective

- Pitch your assigned company or brand in a way that helps your teammates guess it quickly.
- Do **not** say the company or brand name, trademarks, or any prohibited words.
- Avoid **historical or retrospective descriptions** — pitch like it is launching today.
- Watch out for **Instant Death guesses** — guessing a related but incorrect company or brand causes immediate loss for that round.


## Key Concepts

### 1. **Pitch Like It’s New**

- Describe the company or brand *as if it’s brand new* on the market.
- Avoid mentioning its past achievements, legacy, or history.
- Example for "The Simpsons":
  - ❌ “The longest-running animated show.”  
  - ✔️ “A new animated sitcom about a dysfunctional suburban family.”

### 2. **Prohibited Words and Trademarks**

- Company or brand names and trademarks are **never allowed**.
- Each card lists **prohibited words** that cannot be used in your pitch.
- Saying any prohibited word results in losing that round.

### 3. **Instant Death Guesses**

- Each card includes **3 related companies or brands**.
- Only one is the correct answer for the current round.
- Guessing one of the other two immediately ends the round with zero points.


### 4. **Fair Play and Integrity**

- Avoid using synonyms or indirect references to prohibited words that clearly circumvent the rules (e.g., using “Washingtons” for “dollars”).
- Pitches should rely on creative positioning and conceptual clues — not cryptic code words or slang.
- Teams are encouraged to call out and resolve suspected rule violations with a group consensus or moderator decision.
- The spirit of Pitchanary is honest, challenging, and fun gameplay for all participants.

##  How to Play

### Setup

- Divide into two teams.
- Shuffle the Pitchanary deck.
- The game lasts **9 rounds**.

### Each Round

1. Draw **1 card** containing 3 companies or brands (e.g., `["Coke", "Dr Pepper", "Red Bull"]`).
2. Determine the company or brand to pitch based on the round number:
   - Rounds 1, 4, 7 → pitch the **first** company/brand.
   - Rounds 2, 5, 8 → pitch the **second** company/brand.
   - Rounds 3, 6, 9 → pitch the **third** company/brand.
3. The pitcher reads the card and delivers a pitch **without using the prohibited words or trademarks**.
4. Teammates guess aloud:
   - Correct guess: 1 point.
   - Guessing one of the other two companies or brands on the card: **Instant Death**, round ends with zero points.
5. Continue until all 9 rounds are completed.

### Scoring

- 1 point for each correctly guessed company or brand.
- 0 points if prohibited words are used or an Instant Death guess occurs.
- Maximum score is 9 points.

## Strategy Tips

### For Pitchers

- Focus on what differentiates the company or brand from the others on the card.
- Be creative, prospective, and concise.
- Avoid using any jargon, generic terms, or prohibited words.

### For Guessers

- Think carefully and avoid risky guesses.
- Ask teammates for clarifications to narrow down possibilities.
- Remember which companies or brands are “Instant Death” traps this round.


## Example

Presume our card is as follows:
- Companies/Brands: "Tinder", "Hinge", "Bumble"
- Prohibited Words: swipe, match, date, app, profile

Given that:
- Assume it's Round 2: Pitch the **second** company/brand (Hinge).
- Guessing Tinder or Bumble causes Instant Death.


## Ending the Game

- After 9 rounds, add up the points.
- The team with the highest score wins.
- For ties, play a sudden death round with a special tiebreaker card.
