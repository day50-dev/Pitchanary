# üé≤ Pitchanary: Full Game Instructions

---

## 1. Quick Start Overview

- Two teams compete to guess their assigned companies first.
- On your turn, one player **pitches** a company without saying its name, trademarks, banned words or words in the past tense.
- Teammates try to guess the company as fast as possible.
- The first team to guess all 10 companies **wins**!
- **Instant Death Mode**: Guessing a risky competitor loses the game immediately.
- **Pitch Like It‚Äôs New**: Pitch companies as if launching today, not by describing what they became.

---

## 2. Objective

Be the first team to correctly guess all companies in your deck by listening to your teammate‚Äôs pitch ‚Äî but don‚Äôt say forbidden words or trademarks!

Train your pitching skills by focusing on *how you‚Äôd sell* a company *prospectively* rather than *what you know* about it historically.

- Players divide into **2 teams** (4+ players recommended).
- Shuffle the deck of Pitchanary cards.

- Choose which team pitches first.

---

## 4. Components

- **Prohibited Words**: Common words or phrases you cannot say while pitching.
- **Instant Death Companies**: Close competitors or lookalikes that cause immediate loss if guessed.
- **Difficulty Level**: Ranges from 1 (easy) to 3 (hard) based on company size and market crowdedness.

## 5. Core Rules

### 5.1 Pitch Like It‚Äôs New (Mandatory)

- Pitch the company, brand, or product **as if it is brand new, launching today**.
- Do **not** rely on historical achievements, reputation, or legacy.
- Focus on **how you would sell it to someone unfamiliar** at the moment of introduction.
- Examples:  
  - ‚ùå ‚ÄúThe Simpsons is the longest-running animated show.‚Äù  
  - ‚úîÔ∏è ‚ÄúA regressive family sitcom mixing ‚ÄòThe Cosby Show‚Äô with ‚ÄòMarried with Children.‚Äô‚Äù  
  - ‚ùå ‚ÄúNetflix is the biggest streaming platform.‚Äù  
  - ‚úîÔ∏è ‚ÄúA service offering unlimited movies and shows instantly on your TV.‚Äù

### 5.2 Prohibited Words & Instant Death (Mandatory)

- You **cannot say** the company name or any of the **prohibited words** listed on the card.
- You **cannot give indirect clues** such as letter hints, rhymes, or spelling.
- If your team guesses an **Instant Death company** listed on the card, **your team immediately loses and the other team wins**.
- If a Pitcher accidentally uses a prohibited word, apply a penalty (e.g., discard the card, lose time).
- This ensures pitches are **challenging, precise, and focused on unique differentiation**.
